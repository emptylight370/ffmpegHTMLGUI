# Help Us Localize
If you:
- found some translation problems in our project
- want to add translations for your language

please send an **issue** to us, including your translated [translation](translation.js) file in the issue, and add **[localization]** and your **language** in the front of your title.

## Notice:
You **must**
- know how to edit `json` file
- can translate correctly from **English** <small>(or Chinese)</small> to your language
- use the latest [translation](translation.js) file for your job
- check the file updates and update your translations to keep up with our official translation file, if we don't have the latest translations, we will use English to cover the untranslated script
